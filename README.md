# Synflix

A [streaming library](https://synflix.robr.app) for all of your favorite AI-generated movies! *Syn* as in *synthetic* and *ugly-as-ungodly-sin*!

Back in 2023, I created a [site](https://moovi.robr.app) that generated and displayed OpenAI-generated image stills, titles, and taglines for fictional movies. These creations were both fastinating and [grosteque](https://c.tenor.com/eoQAYGpblq4AAAAd/tenor.gif), and I was disheartened that the universe couldn't more fully enjoy these artificial monstrosities. 

Fueled by amaretto sours, I tapped into my desire to dip into static site builders (starting with GatsbyJS) and honor the streaming behemoth that brought me Blue Eye Samurai (seriously, go watch it) to breathe life into a site that really, really glorified these lil' works of deformed art.
